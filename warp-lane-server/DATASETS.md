The IDMT-SMT-GUITAR database is a large database for automatic guitar transcription. Seven different guitars in standard tuning were used with varying pick-up settings and different string measures to ensure a sufficient diversification in the field of electric and acoustic guitars. The recording setup consisted of appropriate audio interfaces, which were directly connected to the guitar output or in one case to a condenser microphone. The recordings are provided in one channel RIFF WAVE format with 44100 Hz sample rate.
